# Iowa Liquor Sales Exploratory Analysis

**This project was done the week of 9/14.**

Purpose: get familiar with the Julia data environment (CSV, DataFrames, Query, etc.).

Problem statement: Which stores should be targeted for Gin distribution?

I answered this question by finding the stores that sold the most bottles of gin.

Future work: time series analysis and forecasting.
